# Segment 1

## Presentation

### Topic

- Topic: Predicting the severity of homelessness and how it correlates with education levels

- Why topic was selected: We think it would be interesting to see if we could predict how severe the homeless situation will be based on existing homelessness data and data about education levels in that state.

### Data Source

We have two CSVs which we pulled from Kaggle.com. The first dataset, 2007-2016_Homelessness_USA.csv, contains counts of homeless by state, Continuum of Care (CoC), and by severity of homeless. The second dataset, state_all.csv, contains education data such as, counts of individuals by state, year, grade level, and math/reading scores.

### Questions to Answer

- What will the severity level of homelessness be next year?

- How does education level affect homelessness?
