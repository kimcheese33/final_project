### Topic

- Topic: Predicting the severity of homelessness and how it correlates with education 

- Why topic was selected: We think it would be interesting to see if we could predict how severe the homeless situation will be based on existing homelessness data and data about education in that state.

### Data Source

We have two CSVs which we pulled from Kaggle.com. The first dataset, 2007-2016_Homelessness_USA.csv, contains counts of homeless by state, Continuum of Care (CoC), and by severity of homelessness. The second dataset, state_all.csv, contains education data such as, counts of individuals by state, year, grade level, and math/reading scores.

### Questions to Answer

- What will the severity level of homelessness be next year?

- How does education level affect homelessness?

## Communication Protocols

- Slack

- Class breakout sessions

- Email
