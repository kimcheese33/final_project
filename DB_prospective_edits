# DB prospective edits:

### 2007-2016-Homelessnewss-USA.csv:

Simplify date to year format “20XX”.

Change state abbreviation to state name, ex: “AK” -> “ALASKA”.

Join separate CoC program data into comprehensive state data, ex: “Alaska Balance of State CoC” + “Alaska Balance of State CoC” = “Alaska CoC”.

Drop redundant/unnecessary “Measures” rows, ex:  keep only  “Total Homeless”, “Unsheltered Homeless”, “Sheltered Homeless”, “Chronically Homeless Individuals”.  

### states_all.csv:

Drop “PRIMARY_KEY”.

Drop year rows that don’t intersect with 2007-2016-Homelessnewss-USA.csv (1992-2006).

There are a lot of columns in the data set that will probably not be useful to our study, but I don’t want to drop them too early and limit the scope of our study. Will be best to decide with the group. Ex: do we need to have expenditure’s sub categories instructional/support/other or will having just the total expenditure suit our needs?
